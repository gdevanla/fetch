UC11 Document office visit Use Case

An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc2(UC2)]]. The iTrust user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3(UC3)]]. 

An HCP chooses to document  or edit  an office visit. 

    The HCP enters a MID  or name of a patient and confirms their selection . The HCP documents the office visit date; hospital location of the office visit, if any, (the default should be the HCP's home location); and notes (numbers, characters, #, ;, ?, -, ', ., :, blankspace and carriage return are all allowed input values) about an office visit. The HCP's medical identification number should also be maintained. Additionally, the HCP can document none, one, or more medications (NDC, see [[requirements:df6Data Format 6.6]]) prescribed ; none, one, or more lab procedures that are ordered (LOINC code, see [[requirements:df11Data Format 6.11]])[[requirements:uc26(UC26)]]; none, one, or more diagnoses (via the ICD-9CM code); none, one, or more medical procedures (CPT code) performed; and none, one, or more immunizations given (CPT Code, see [[requirements:uc15UC15]], S1) chosen from appropriate pull-down lists. The HCP may also add a patient referral [[requirements:uc33(UC33)]]. All events are logged [[requirements:uc5(UC5, S8)]]. 
    HCPs can return to an office visit and modify or delete the fields of the office visit [date, hospital, notes, prescriptions, laboratory procedures [[requirements:uc26(UC26)]], referral [[requirements:uc33(UC33)]], diagnoses, procedures, and/or immunizations]. The event is logged [[requirements:uc5(UC 5, S8)]] and the HCP is returned in the specific office visit record to verify his or her changes. 
    The HCP has selected a medication prescribed from a pull down list. The HCP provides the dosage in milligrams, the start and end date for the prescription, and any special instructions. The instructions can contain numbers, characters, #, ;, ?, -, ', ., :, blankspace and carriage return. The HCP must provide instructions (can neither be empty nor the default form field value), or else they cannot add the prescription. The HCP can add the prescription to the list of medications [[requirements:uc37(UC37)]].

    The HCP types an invalid medical identification number and is prompted to try again.
    The patient chosen is not the desired patient. The health care personnel does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.
