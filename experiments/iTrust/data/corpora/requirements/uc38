UC38 Maintain Drug Interaction Use Case

The iTrust user (admin) has been authenticated in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3(UC3)]].

The administrator records  or deletes  a drug interaction between two prescription drugs.

    The administer is presented with two lists of NDC codes/names. The administrator chooses a drug from each list to record an interaction between the two drugs . The two drugs and a textual description of the possible effects of the interaction are stored.
    The administrator selects one drug and is presented with a listing of all drug interactions currently associated with that drug. The administrator can select a particular pair of drugs and delete the interaction between the two drugs.

    The administrator has chosen the same drug from both lists. The system directs the user to make a different choice.
