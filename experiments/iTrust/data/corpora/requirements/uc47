UC47 Find an Expert Use Case

A patient has authenticated him or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc2(UC2)]].

   The patient needs to find an HCP with a particular specialty (OB/GYN, Surgeon, etc), and selects that speciality from a drop-down list.
      OB/GYN
      Surgeon
      Heart Surgeon
      Pediatrician
      General Physician
   A table of all of the hospitals within 10 miles of the patient's stored home address that contain an HCP with that specialty is displayed, including their name and address. Under each hospital, the name and contact e-mail of the specialist is displayed.
   The event is logged.
   Extra Credit: A map with the hospitals in range marked on it is also displayed, in addition to the table

    The patient uses a text field to change the radius in which hospitals are discovered.</textarea>
