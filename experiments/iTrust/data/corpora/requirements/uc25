UC25 View Physician Satisfaction Survey Results Use Case

The iTrust user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3(UC3)]].

A user chooses to view physician satisfaction survey results. The user provides a zip code  or a hospital code and an (optional) physician type (from a pull-down list: see [[requirements:df2data format 6.2]] - general, surgeon, heart specialist, pediatrician, OB/GYN). The patient is provided with the following for each physician of that type that practices in a zip code (based upon the address/zipcode provided in [[requirements:uc2UC2]]) that match the first three digits of the provided zip code:
   Name
   Address
   Average number of minutes patients wait in waiting room
   Average number of minutes patients wait in examination room prior to seeing physician
   Average office visit satisfaction
   Average satisfaction with treatment/information
   Percentage of office visits for which satisfaction information is available

None

    The input is not a valid zip code (see [[requirements:df2Data Format 6.2]]). The user is asked to try again.
