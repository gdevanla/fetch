The patient has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3(UC3)]].

The patient chooses to view all LHCPs the patient has ever had an office visit with and those whom he/she had designated [S1, S2]. The patient can also add a LHCP to their provider list by searching for the name and/or specialty of a LHCP  and then selecting to add the HCP to their list of providers.

    The LHCP's name, specialty, address, date of office visit, and whether or not the LHCP is a DLHCP for this patient is indicated. The list is sorted by the date of the last office visit (most recent first).
    The patient can choose to toggle between designating/undesignating any LHCP as being a DLHCP for them.
    The patient types a last name or partial last name, and/or providing the specialty. The patient may optionally enter a zip code (match on first three numbers of zip code), in addition to the name and/or specialty. The LHCP's name, specialty, and address are provided.
