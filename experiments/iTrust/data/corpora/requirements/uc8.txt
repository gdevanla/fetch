UC8 View Access Log Use Case

A patient is a registered user of the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc1(UC1)]]. The patient has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system [[requirements:uc3(UC3)]].

The patient chooses to view his or her access log or that for a person for whom they are a personal health representative. The patient then chooses the beginning and end date for the period of time they would like to view their access log for [S1, S2]. The resulting list should include the following for each access:
   Name of non-DLHCP accessor (with a link to contact information if the viewer is an LHCP)
   Role of non-DLHCP accessor relative to the patient
   Date and time of access
   Transaction Type (See [[requirements:df3Data Format 6.3]])

    By default, the patient is presented with a list sorted by dates, most recent access first.
    The patient may choose to view the list sorted by the role of the accessor relative to the patient (personal health representative, LHCP, UAP, Emergency Responder; any order is fine as long as the list is sorted by role) as well as by date for each role type, most recent access first.
