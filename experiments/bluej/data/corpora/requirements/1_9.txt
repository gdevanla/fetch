Create (executable) Jar filesmenu: Project/Create Jar File...Jar files can be created directly from BlueJ. Jar files include all files of a givenproject in a single file. This presents a convenient way to transfer a project fromone location to another. Jar files can be made executable, effectively creating anapplication that can be started by double-clicking.In BlueJ, jar files are created by choosing the Create Jar File function from theProject menu. A dialogue similar to the one shown here will be displayed.If the jar file is to be executable (so that, for example, a double-click in Windowswill start it) select the "main class" from the popup menu. The main class mustcontain a standard main method which will be executed to start the application.The BlueJ Environment Reference Manual, Version 2.05If the project has access to external libraries, as described in Specify libraries thatare to be used in all projects and Specify libraries that are to be used in a singleproject, an area titled Include user libraries will be displayed in the middle ofthe dialogue. (If no libraries are used, this area will be absent.) Check everylibrary that the current project uses.If no libraries have been included, a single jar file will be created. If libraries areincluded, a folder is created and the executable jar file is put in there along withthe library jar files. The executable jar file needs to be in the same folder as thelibrary jar file to function. It is possible to change the location which theexecutable jar file expects to find the library jar files, by editing its manifest.Once you click Continue, you will be prompted for a file name for the jar file.
