Find errors in the sourceTo check the source of a class for error, you just Compile a class. Compilationwill highlight the first error in the source and display the error message in theinformation area in the editor window.Compilation only shows one error at a time. To see other errors, fix the first oneand compile again.If you need help to understand the error message, click the icon. BlueJ willthen try to explain the error message in straight forward terms.
