Make BlueJ backup my sourcefilesThe propertybluej.makeBackupis a boolean property (its values are true or false) for switching backup on oroff. This property provides the default. Users can modify this setting using theirpreferences dialog. When backup is active, a backupfile is created in the samedirectory as the original each time the original is saved. The backupfile has thesame name as the original with a ‘~’ appended.
