Configure the documentation generationSpecify the command used for generating documentation by editing the propertydoctool.command=javadocby default the javadoc command located in the JDK directory that was used tolaunch BlueJ is used.Change the options given to the doctool command by editing the propetydoctool.options=-author –version –nodepricated –packageFor instance, if you want private methods included in the documentation, change“-package” in the options to “-private”. Consult the documentation for javadoc atjava.sun.com for more options.To change the directory name within the project directory where thedocumantation is stored, edit the propertydoctool.outputdir=docIf "linkToStandardLib" is true, we will try to use the URL specified in the"bluej.url.javaStdLib" property, to create links. If that URL is not accessible,documentation generation will fail. Therefore, if you want to work offline, set"linkToStandardLib" to false (you can also do that from within BlueJ in thePreferences dialog).
