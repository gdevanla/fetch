Move objects to the object benchSome expression results are objects, rather than simple values. In this case, theresult is shown as <object reference>, followed by the type of the object, and asmall object icon is painted next to the result line.The small object icon can be used to continue working with the resulting object.Point to the icon and drag it onto the object bench. This will place the object ontothe bench, where it will be available for further calls to its methods, either via itspopup menu or via the code padThe BlueJ Environment Reference Manual, Version 2.029Some expressions that will create objects are:new Student()"marmelade".substring(3,8)new java.util.Random()"hello" + "world"
