Compile a projectmenu: Tools/Compile shortcut: Ctrl-k toolbar button: CompileTo compile a project, select Compile from the menu or toolbar. This functionwill make an analysis of the current project, check which classes needrecompilation, check dependencies, and then compile all classes that needcompilation in the appropriate order.This function will always try to compile all uncompiled classes. If errors aredetected, each class with one or more errors is opened and the first error isdisplayed. To compile one or more specific classes without compiling them all,see Compile A Class.
