Use variablesLocal variables in the code pad, are only useful as part of multi-line statementsequences, since variables are discarded between separate inputs. An example:int sum;sum = 0;for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {sum += i;}System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);Entering the same sequence as separate input statements, will fail, since the localvariable sum is not remembered between inputs.All code that is legal to write in the body of a Java method is also legal in thecode pad. However, every text input typed, forms the part of a different method,so one line of input cannot refer to a variable declared in another.Object bench variables behave as instance fields. They cannot be defined fromwithin a method body (or from the code pad), but they can be referred to andcalls to the objects held in them can be made.8.6 Inspect object on
