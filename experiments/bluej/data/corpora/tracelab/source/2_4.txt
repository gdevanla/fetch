Compile a classmain window:menu: Tools/Compile Selected shortcut: Shift-Ctrl-k context menu: Compileeditor:menu: Tools/Compile shortcut: Ctrl-k toolbar button: CompileThere are two ways to compile a particular class: from the main window or fromthe editor.In the main window, select the class(es) and then select Compile Selected fromthe Tools menu.If the class is open, select Compile from the Tools menu or the toolbar in theeditor.Both of these functions do the same thing: they will first analyse thedependencies of the selected class and check whether a class that this onedepends on is uncompiled. Classes that this one depends on are classes used andthe parent class (if any). Those classes are compiled first, if necessary, and thenthe selected class is compiled. Thus, it is not necessary to explicitly compile usedclasses first. If an error is found it will be highlighted and an error message isdisplayed (the class will be opened if it is not open already). If no error is found,the class will be marked as compiled in both the editor and the main window.It is not necessary to save classes before compilation. They will be implicitlysaved before compilation takes place if they were changed since the last save.
