Inspect variable values in my programIf you want to inspect the value of instance variables between interactive methodcalls, see Inspect an object.If you want to see the value of local variables or instance variables at a particularmoment of the execution, Set a breakpoint at the place in the code where youwant to inspect the variable. Once execution reaches the breakpoint and thedebugger window is shown.You can inspect any object listed in the variable list by double clicking it, just asfor interactive objects on the object bench, as described in Inspect an object.
