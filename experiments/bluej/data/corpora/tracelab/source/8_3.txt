Evaluate multi line expressionsSequences of statements or statements spanning multiple lines can be entered byusing shift-Enter at the end of the input line. Using shift-enter will move thecursor to the start of the next line, but not (yet) execute the input. At the end ofthe last input line type Enter to evaluate all lines together. Try, for example, a forloop:for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {System.out.println("number: " + i);}
